## Summary of Dataset  
  
Driver process models play a central role in the testing, verification, and development of automated and autonomous vehicle technologies. Prior models developed from control theory and physics-based rules are limited in automated vehicle applications due to their restricted behavioral repertoire. Data-driven machine learning models are more capable than rule-based models but are limited by the need for large training datasets and their lack of interpretability. In this project we developed a novel car following modeling approach using active inference, which has comparable behavioral flexibility to data-driven models while maintaining interpretability. We assessed the proposed model, the Active Inference Driving Agent (AIDA), through a benchmark analysis against several benchmarks. The models were trained and tested on a real-world driving dataset using a consistent process. The testing results showed that the AIDA predicted driving controls significantly better than the rule-based Intelligent Driver Model and had similar accuracy to the data driven neural network models in three out of four evaluations. Subsequent interpretability analyses illustrated that the AIDA's learned distributions were consistent with driver behavior theory and that visualizations of the distributions could be used to directly comprehend the model's decision-making process and correct model errors attributable to limited training data.

## C. Data and Related Files Overview  

We use the publicly available INTERACTION dataset. The INTERACTION dataset is collected using drones on fixed road segments in the USA, Germany, and China. The dataset provides a lanelet2 format map and a set of time-indexed trajectories of the positions, velocities, and headings of each vehicle in the scene in the map's coordinate system at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz, and the vehicle's length and width for each road segment.

**Instrument or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:** To best view the data, please open the .CSV files in Notepad++, Excel, or OpenRefine.  

### Setup  
* Environment variables are in [environment.yml](environment.yml). You might run into an OMP error installing numpy, scipy along with pytorch in anaconda. You can fix this by first installing nomkl (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53014306/error-15-initializing-libiomp5-dylib-but-found-libiomp5-dylib-already-initial)).
* Download the [INTERACTION dataset](https://interaction-dataset.com/) and perform the preprocessing steps described in [here](./doc/preprocess.md).

### Usage  
To train the active inference and basedline agents, run:
```
python ./scripts/train_agent_recurrent.py
```
You can modify observation features, agent size, learning rate, training epochs by specifying additional arguments. You can use the corresponding ``.sh`` script to edit these arguments. Please see the scripts for detailed arguments.  To train agents in colab, clone the repo to google drive and run the corresponding ``.ipynb`` file. 

To test agents on static dataset, run:
```
python ./scripts/eval_offline.py
```

To test agents in simulator, run:
```
python ./scripts/eval_online.py
```
Description of the simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/ran-weii/interactive_inference/blob/master/doc/simulation.md).
